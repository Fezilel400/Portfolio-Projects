The data used for this project was found from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, about covid  deaths from the year 2020(january) to 2021 (august)
after downloading the data which came in a excel file
I moved to EXCEL to organised, cleaned it and seperated the original excel file into two tables(covidDeaths and covidVacciations) for the join function i was planing to use on SQL later 
after saving the files i went to SQL and imported the files and using different QUERYs to extract specific imformation. to show my familiarity with SQL function.
